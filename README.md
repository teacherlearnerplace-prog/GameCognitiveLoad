The Cognitive Load Lab is an interactive simulator that visualizes how intrinsic, extraneous, and germane loads compete for limited working memory capacity. It demonstrates the "expertise reversal effect" by showing how developing schemas through chunking can effectively reduce task difficulty and prevent cognitive overload.
